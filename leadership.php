        <p class="card-text">We Are Committed To Bring Out The Best In You Because – YOU are our inspiration ..

		Our ultimate aim is to carve out a career of excellence for all our students, and hence every activity in VISHIST, Indore will be Industry-centric. We ensure excellent teaching standards, frequent industry interaction and mentoring support whenever necessary.

			Opportunities are visible everywhere. Despite the global slowdown, GDP growth has not stopped or turned negative. There are very few truly qualified people for large jobs. Industry is struggling to cope with half-baked graduates and under-prepared post-graduates , there is a need of in-depth understanding of even basic topics.

			This is what led to the creation of VISHISHT. As educationist & industry professional , I realized that there was a huge scope to create a “Institute” that focused beyond the mere award of diplomas and degrees. That there was a need to provide a Practical Exposure & Industry Interaction with students to create real professionals . In the process. I realized that if we could bring all our experience, learning, contacts and good intent together to create a good programmer that lifted the students to a different plane of understanding, involvement and joy, the students would be lapped up by a grateful industry and VISHISHT, Indore surely be counted among the nation’s best collge .

			We invite all those who share our vision, goals and purpose to join hands in an efforts to build a new cadre of Management Professionals who will participate actively in the growth in this era of economic liberalization and globalization.
